### Methods

Go does not have classes. However, you can define methods on types.

A method is a function with a special receiver argument.

The receiver appears in its own argument list between the func keyword and the method name.

In this example, the Abs method has a receiver of type Vertex named v.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
}
```

### Methods are functions

Remember: a method is just a function with a receiver argument.

Here's Abs written as a regular function with no change in functionality.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func Abs(v Vertex) float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	fmt.Println(Abs(v))
}
```

You can declare a method on non-struct types, too.

In this example we see a numeric type MyFloat with an Abs method.

You can only declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in the same package as the method. You cannot declare a method with a receiver whose type is defined in another package (which includes the built-in types such as int).

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type MyFloat float64

func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
	if f < 0 {
		return float64(-f)
	}
	return float64(f)
}

func main() {
	f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
	fmt.Println(f.Abs())
}
```

### Pointer receivers

You can declare methods with pointer receivers.

This means the receiver type has the literal syntax *T for some type T. (Also, T cannot itself be a pointer such as *int.)

For example, the Scale method here is defined on \*Vertex.

Methods with pointer receivers can modify the value to which the receiver points (as Scale does here). Since methods often need to modify their receiver, pointer receivers are more common than value receivers.

Try removing the \* from the declaration of the Scale function on line 16 and observe how the program's behavior changes.

With a value receiver, the Scale method operates on a copy of the original Vertex value. (This is the same behavior as for any other function argument.) The Scale method must have a pointer receiver to change the Vertex value declared in the main function.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func (v *Vertex) Scale(f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	v.Scale(10)
	fmt.Println(v.Abs())
}
```

### Pointers and functions

Here we see the Abs and Scale methods rewritten as functions.

Again, try removing the \* from line 16. Can you see why the behavior changes? What else did you need to change for the example to compile?

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func Abs(v Vertex) float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}

func Scale(v *Vertex, f float64) {
	v.X = v.X * f
	v.Y = v.Y * f
}

func main() {
	v := Vertex{3, 4}
	Scale(&v, 10)
	fmt.Println(Abs(v))
}
```

### Interfaces

An interface type is defined as a set of method signatures.

A value of interface type can hold any value that implements those methods.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math"
)

type Abser interface {
	Abs() float64
}

func main() {
	var a Abser
	f := MyFloat(-math.Sqrt2)
	v := Vertex{3, 4}

	a = f  // a MyFloat implements Abser
	a = &v // a *Vertex implements Abser

	// In the following line, v is a Vertex (not *Vertex)
	// and does NOT implement Abser.
	a = v

	fmt.Println(a.Abs())
}

type MyFloat float64

func (f MyFloat) Abs() float64 {
	if f < 0 {
		return float64(-f)
	}
	return float64(f)
}

type Vertex struct {
	X, Y float64
}

func (v *Vertex) Abs() float64 {
	return math.Sqrt(v.X*v.X + v.Y*v.Y)
}
```

### Errors

o programs express error state with error values.

The error type is a built-in interface similar to fmt.Stringer:

```go
type error interface {
Error() string
}
```

(As with fmt.Stringer, the fmt package looks for the error interface when printing values.)

Functions often return an error value, and calling code should handle errors by testing whether the error equals nil.

```go
i, err := strconv.Atoi("42")
if err != nil {
fmt.Printf("couldn't convert number: %v\n", err)
return
}
fmt.Println("Converted integer:", i)
```

A nil error denotes success; a non-nil error denotes failure.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

type MyError struct {
	When time.Time
	What string
}

func (e *MyError) Error() string {
	return fmt.Sprintf("at %v, %s",
		e.When, e.What)
}

func run() error {
	return &MyError{
		time.Now(),
		"it didn't work",
	}
}

func main() {
	if err := run(); err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
	}
}
```

### Exercise: Errors

Copy your Sqrt function from the earlier exercise and modify it to return an error value.

Sqrt should return a non-nil error value when given a negative number, as it doesn't support complex numbers.
