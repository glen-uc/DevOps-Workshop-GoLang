### Goroutines

A goroutine is a lightweight thread managed by the Go runtime.

go f(x, y, z)
starts a new goroutine running

f(x, y, z)
The evaluation of f, x, y, and z happens in the current goroutine and the execution of f happens in the new goroutine.

Goroutines run in the same address space, so access to shared memory must be synchronized. The sync package provides useful primitives, although you won't need them much in Go as there are other primitives. (See the next slide.)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"time"
)

func say(s string) {
	for i := 0; i < 5; i++ {
		time.Sleep(100 * time.Millisecond)
		fmt.Println(s)
	}
}

func main() {
	go say("world")
	say("hello")
}
```

### Channels

Channels are a typed conduit through which you can send and receive values with the channel operator, <-.

```go
ch <- v    // Send v to channel ch.
v := <-ch  // Receive from ch, and
           // assign value to v.
```

(The data flows in the direction of the arrow.)

Like maps and slices, channels must be created before use:

```go
ch := make(chan int)
```

By default, sends and receives block until the other side is ready. This allows goroutines to synchronize without explicit locks or condition variables.

The example code sums the numbers in a slice, distributing the work between two goroutines. Once both goroutines have completed their computation, it calculates the final result.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func sum(s []int, c chan int) {
	sum := 0
	for _, v := range s {
		sum += v
	}
	c <- sum // send sum to c
}

func main() {
	s := []int{7, 2, 8, -9, 4, 0}

	c := make(chan int)
	go sum(s[:len(s)/2], c)
	go sum(s[len(s)/2:], c)
	x, y := <-c, <-c // receive from c

	fmt.Println(x, y, x+y)
}
```

### Buffered Channels

Channels can be buffered. Provide the buffer length as the second argument to make to initialize a buffered channel:

ch := make(chan int, 100)
Sends to a buffered channel block only when the buffer is full. Receives block when the buffer is empty.

Modify the example to overfill the buffer and see what happens.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
	ch := make(chan int, 2)
	ch <- 1
	ch <- 2
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
	fmt.Println(<-ch)
}
```

### Range and Close

A sender can close a channel to indicate that no more values will be sent. Receivers can test whether a channel has been closed by assigning a second parameter to the receive expression: after

```go
v, ok := <-ch
```

ok is false if there are no more values to receive and the channel is closed.

The loop for i := range c receives values from the channel repeatedly until it is closed.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

func fibonacci(n int, c chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for i := 0; i < n; i++ {
		c <- x
		x, y = y, x+y
	}
	close(c)
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int, 10)
	go fibonacci(cap(c), c)
	for i := range c {
		fmt.Println(i)
	}
}
```

### Select

The select statement lets a goroutine wait on multiple communication operations.

A select blocks until one of its cases can run, then it executes that case. It chooses one at random if multiple are ready.

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func fibonacci(c, quit chan int) {
	x, y := 0, 1
	for {
		select {
		case c <- x:
			x, y = y, x+y
		case <-quit:
			fmt.Println("quit")
			return
		}
	}
}

func main() {
	c := make(chan int)
	quit := make(chan int)
	go func() {
		for i := 0; i < 10; i++ {
			fmt.Println(<-c)
		}
		quit <- 0
	}()
	fibonacci(c, quit)
}
```
### sync.Mutex

We've seen how channels are great for communication among goroutines.

But what if we don't need communication? What if we just want to make sure only one goroutine can access a variable at a time to avoid conflicts?

This concept is called mutual exclusion, and the conventional name for the data structure that provides it is mutex.

Go's standard library provides mutual exclusion with sync.Mutex and its two methods:

Lock
Unlock
We can define a block of code to be executed in mutual exclusion by surrounding it with a call to Lock and Unlock as shown on the Inc method.

We can also use defer to ensure the mutex will be unlocked as in the Value method.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"sync"
	"time"
)

// SafeCounter is safe to use concurrently.
type SafeCounter struct {
	mu sync.Mutex
	v  map[string]int
}

// Inc increments the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Inc(key string) {
	c.mu.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	c.v[key]++
	c.mu.Unlock()
}

// Value returns the current value of the counter for the given key.
func (c *SafeCounter) Value(key string) int {
	c.mu.Lock()
	// Lock so only one goroutine at a time can access the map c.v.
	defer c.mu.Unlock()
	return c.v[key]
}

func main() {
	c := SafeCounter{v: make(map[string]int)}
	for i := 0; i < 1000; i++ {
		go c.Inc("somekey")
	}

	time.Sleep(time.Second)
	fmt.Println(c.Value("somekey"))
}
```
### Exercise: Web Crawler


```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
)

type Fetcher interface {
	// Fetch returns the body of URL and
	// a slice of URLs found on that page.
	Fetch(url string) (body string, urls []string, err error)
}

// Crawl uses fetcher to recursively crawl
// pages starting with url, to a maximum of depth.
func Crawl(url string, depth int, fetcher Fetcher) {
	// TODO: Fetch URLs in parallel.
	// TODO: Don't fetch the same URL twice.
	// This implementation doesn't do either:
	if depth <= 0 {
		return
	}
	body, urls, err := fetcher.Fetch(url)
	if err != nil {
		fmt.Println(err)
		return
	}
	fmt.Printf("found: %s %q\n", url, body)
	for _, u := range urls {
		Crawl(u, depth-1, fetcher)
	}
	return
}

func main() {
	Crawl("https://golang.org/", 4, fetcher)
}

// fakeFetcher is Fetcher that returns canned results.
type fakeFetcher map[string]*fakeResult

type fakeResult struct {
	body string
	urls []string
}

func (f fakeFetcher) Fetch(url string) (string, []string, error) {
	if res, ok := f[url]; ok {
		return res.body, res.urls, nil
	}
	return "", nil, fmt.Errorf("not found: %s", url)
}

// fetcher is a populated fakeFetcher.
var fetcher = fakeFetcher{
	"https://golang.org/": &fakeResult{
		"The Go Programming Language",
		[]string{
			"https://golang.org/pkg/",
			"https://golang.org/cmd/",
		},
	},
	"https://golang.org/pkg/": &fakeResult{
		"Packages",
		[]string{
			"https://golang.org/",
			"https://golang.org/cmd/",
			"https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/",
			"https://golang.org/pkg/os/",
		},
	},
	"https://golang.org/pkg/fmt/": &fakeResult{
		"Package fmt",
		[]string{
			"https://golang.org/",
			"https://golang.org/pkg/",
		},
	},
	"https://golang.org/pkg/os/": &fakeResult{
		"Package os",
		[]string{
			"https://golang.org/",
			"https://golang.org/pkg/",
		},
	},
}
